In this repository we learn about the command shell or terminal shell it is a text base interface which allow us to operate system by using words.
We learn that how to make an file in wsl by just using some codes etc.
For this first we open wsl(Linux) in our after this we use some code words like cd,temp, ls and mkdir etc.
Here cd temp command is for to go into a folder named temp, mkdir is for to make a new folder.
For go to back one folder we use cd.. also cat file.txt is for to see the content of the file. These are some important code words for wsl.
To make a file in wsl first we install ubuntu in wsl menu. Then we use the nano (your file Name).txt command to create a new file.
Example, if i want to make a file name anwarul.txt then i will write none anwarul.txt command.
Then, ctrl+o to save it thwen,I press enter i makes a file in current folder named anwarul.txt.
